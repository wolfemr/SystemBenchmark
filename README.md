System Bencharmk
Michael Wolfe, 2025


This application is designed as a pseudo-benchmark for system performance.


The benchmark is a Java application that fills and empties several common data structures with random integers, measuring the total time required to complete the operations (ms)


To run the test, download the SystemBenchmark.jar file and execute with 'java -jar filename.jar'
